# Better TweetDeckÂ³

This is the 3.0 branch for Better TweetDeck. Like the 2.0 version it's a rewrite-from-scratch.

# What? A rewrite _again_ ?!

Yep. 2.0 was faster and more efficient than 1.0 but the codebase was messy. And there was too much DOM dependant code.

# Goals for 3.0

- Try to hook the BTD content script to as much TweetDeck's events as possible. Resulting in a (virtually) event-driven BetterTweetDeck. Which is awesome for performances and maintainability.
- Thanks to the first point I can reduce the amount of `DOMNodeInserted` listeners. And that's a relief because they were awful to maintain anyway
- Use ES2015 as much as I can. Chrome supports a lot of its features but the project will be using [Babel](http://babeljs.io) and [Babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) to handle the new `module` syntax.
- Reduce the JS files' size as much as possible by using ES2015 features

# Ok that's cool, what about features?

For now, there won't be new features. But I have some of them in mind:

- [ ] Advanced muting engine (imagine using regex like on Tweetbot or mute hashtag based on user's and stuff like that)
  - [ ] Could use a custom format with import/export of config for easy sharing of mute and stuff
  - [ ] Maybe a "I don't want to see this tweet" feature, who knows
- [x] Replace different APIs by Embed.ly to simplify the code **a lot**
- [ ] Display a little flag depending on the _supposed_ language of the tweet ?
- [ ] Display a little avatar next to contacts in the "All accounts" messages column so you know easily with which account a thread began with

# Ports

Edge and Firefox are going to support extensions running through the [WebExtensions API](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions) so Better TweetDeck should be able to get to Edge/Firefox in the future with almost no code changes! :tada:
