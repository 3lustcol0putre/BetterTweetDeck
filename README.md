BetterTweetDeck
===============

Adds some nice options on TweetDeck to provide a better experience on the webapp when used on Chrome.

Features
===============

As 0.0.4

+ Thumbnails for Imgur and Droplr images links
+ Allow to change the time formatting (Relative or Absolute)
+ Allow to change the username/fullname formatting (Username only, Fullname only or both)
+ Display fancy circled avatars (they're hipsters, but they're cute too!)
+ Remove that god-damn useless t.co redirection on links


TODO
===============

+ Fix the UI icons that suck since the last update
+ Feel free to fill an issue/pull request for any cool features !


Installation
===============

At the time being, the extension isn't on the Chrome Web Store, as soon as I get something good enough for that, I will publish it on Chrome Web Store.
