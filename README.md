BetterTweetDeck
===============

Adds some nice options on TweetDeck to provide a better experience on the webapp when used on Chrome.

Features
===============

As 0.0.3

+ Now display thumbnails for Imgur image links
+ Allow to change the time formatting (Relative or Absolute)
+ Allow to change the username/fullname formatting (Username only, Fullname only or both)
+ Display fancy circled avatars (they're hipsters, but they're cute too!)
+ Remove that god-damn useless t.co redirection on links
+ And probably more as I get ideas about TweetDeck weaknesses
