22 Jump Street is not only a comedy, but also a parody of sequels and cop movies. The film constantly makes fun of its own premise and the clichÃ©s of the genre. It also references other films and pop culture, such as The Godfather Part II, Scarface, Annie Hall and Benny Hill. The film also breaks the fourth wall several times, such as when the characters acknowledge that they are in a sequel and that their budget is higher.
 
The film also features a talented supporting cast, including Ice Cube as Captain Dickson, the angry boss of Schmidt and Jenko; Peter Stormare as The Ghost, a drug lord and the main antagonist; Amber Stevens West as Maya, Schmidt's love interest and Dickson's daughter; Wyatt Russell as Zook, Jenko's friend and a football star; Jillian Bell as Mercedes, Maya's roommate and a hitwoman; and Nick Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy, who assigns Schmidt and Jenko to their mission.
 
22 Jump Street also has a memorable soundtrack, composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. The film features several songs by various artists, such as Wiz Khalifa, Angel Haze, Diplo, Travis Barker, Juicy J and Ludacris. The film also has an original rap song performed by Hill and Tatum, called "22 Jump Street (Theme from the Motion Picture)", which plays during the end credits. The song is a parody of rap songs that summarize the plot of the film.
