XBCD stands for X-Box Controller Driver and it has been around for almost as long as the original Xbox controllers themselves (approximately 2001-2003). It allows you to use original Xbox controllers and peripherals on Windows PCs, including the DDR pad. In this article, we will show you how to install and configure XBCD on your Windows 10 64-bit PC and enjoy your old-school dance games.
 
## What You Need
 
Before you start, you will need the following items:
 
- An original Xbox DDR pad. You can use any model or brand, as long as it has the proprietary Xbox connector.
- An adapter to connect the Xbox DDR pad to your PC. You can either buy one online or make one yourself by splicing a USB cable on the end of the Xbox connector. You can find a guide on how to do that [here](https://www.s-config.com/xbcd-original-xbox-controllers-win10/#Splice).
- The XBCD driver software. You can download it for free from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbcd/).
- A Windows 10 64-bit PC with an available USB port.

## How to Install XBCD
 
Once you have everything ready, follow these steps to install XBCD on your PC:

1. Extract the XBCD zip file to a folder of your choice.
2. Plug in your Xbox DDR pad to your PC using the adapter.
3. Open Device Manager and look for an unknown device under Other devices. This is your Xbox DDR pad.
4. Right-click on the unknown device and select Update driver.
5. Select Browse my computer for driver software.
6. Select Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer.
7. Select Have disk and browse to the folder where you extracted the XBCD zip file.
8. Select xbcd.inf and click Open.
9. Select XBCD Xbox Controller from the list and click Next.
10. You might get a warning message saying that the driver is not digitally signed. Click Install this driver software anyway and wait for the installation to finish.

Congratulations, you have successfully installed XBCD on your PC. Now you need to configure it for your Xbox DDR pad.
